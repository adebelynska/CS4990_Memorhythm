Final Project generating AI.

## Getting Started

This project is a music app, called "Memorythm", in Flutter using the language Dart that:
- gives the user a prompt to input words or phrases the user remembers from a song
- gives the user a prompt to mention the singer's name (optional, if the user remembers it)
- has a generative AI that generates all these inputs (words/phrases and artist's name), 
  and gives a list of songs (up to 5 songs) that the user may refer to.
